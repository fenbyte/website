<h2>{{ page.title }}</h2>

<p><b>my primary undying interest is technology</b>, ever since i was a small kid i was reaching for the family computer and wanting to take stuff apart to see how they work. i like loads of aspects of it, from hardware, to software, to linux, to old computers and phones, to modding, to homebrew, to keyboards, to mice, to audio, to controllers, to system administration, to media codecs, to emulation, and probably more than im totally forgetting. im the kind of nerd that will host web services and gameservers for fun and not money. if you wanna know exactly what devices and software i use, check out the tech page!</p>

<p><b>another long time interest of mine is games</b>. i grew up with a playstation 2, wii, and a ds, the latter 2 of which were able to run pirated games through a backup loader and an r4 card respectively. nowadays i do most of my gaming on pc, but i do have some consoles lying around like a switch, xbox 360, ps3, a wii u, a 3ds, and a ps vita. im mainly into shooters, platformers, and rhythm games, but i do stray and play some action-adventure games sometimes. the mainstay games i regularly come back to are team fortress 2, minecraft, overwatch 2, battlebit remastered, beat saber, vrchat, and dancerail3. i dont play many of the newer multiplayer shooters because i use linux which isnt compatible with most of the anticheats in use nowadays. i sometimes go back and replay some of my favourite singleplayer games, too, like arkham city, oneshot, undertale, celeste, doom eternal, mirrors edge catalyst, gta v, sonic mania, and quite a few more. i also have a ton of games queued up for me to play too. if you wanna know what im playing now, feel free to come ask me directly! if ive recently played a game thats particularly good, i might also blog about it, so check that out too</p>

<p><b>i also consider myself to be pretty into music</b>. maybe others would disagree, since im very picky so the music i like to listen to most is pretty limited. i do collect cds of my favourite albums and have a pretty big library of flacs. generally my favourite genres are punk rock, breakcore, electronic, dubstep, vaporwave, and sometimes ambient. my favourite bands/artists are blink-182, the offspring, geoxor, femtanyl, windows 96, neck deep, home, and whitewoods. if you wanna see what im listening to, check out the last.fm widget on the right of this page (or the bottom if youre on a phone) or just go to my last.fm profile directly. i scrobble everything i listen to, regardless of device or format. also feel free to ask me for my spotify playlists :3</p>

<p><b>some smaller stuff about me</b>: i have quite a wide selection of pride flags, im really picky about food but i really like eating garbage, i'm absolutely obsessed with drinking pepsi max specifically, i like watching tv shows and movies (specifically cartoons), i hyperfixate on stuff a lot and have special interests, im very sex/kink/body positive, im politically very left, and ive been through a lot of shit so im pretty sensitive and mentally ill lol</p>

<p>if theres anything else you wanna know about me, or just wanna chat, dont be afraid to come talk to me! i consider myself pretty friendly and chill, but i might be a bit shy if i dont know you well yet. dont take it personally, i wont be annoyed or bite you, im just nervous x3</p>

<!-- old
<p>im fen! im a 21 year old british non-binary furry nerd</p>
<p>i like screwing around with computers and technology, playing a bunch of games like tf2 or minecraft, hanging out on forums and in games like vrchat, listening to a wide variety of music like punk rock and breakcore, catching up on all the movies and tv shows i spent 2 decades not watching, eating delicious trash like chicken and pizza, drinking the only beverage that matters (pepsi max), and designing things like this website! im very autistic and all different kinds of queer including being non-binary, transfem, and omnisexual. im very silly (mentally ill), tend to hyperfixate on niche shit a lot, am incredibly sex and kink positive, and politically very left.</p>
<p>if youd like to be friends i think that would be very cool, but please be warned that even if i think youre awesome ill probably seem very disinterested and distant because im very shy and nervous, but if i warm up to you i will probably then become incredibly annoying and clingy &gt;~&lt;</p>
