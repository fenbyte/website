<h2>{{ page.title }}</h2>

<p><b>my primary undying interest is technology,</b> ever since i was a small kid i was reaching for the family computer and wanting to take stuff apart to see how they work. i like loads of aspects of it, from hardware, to software, to linux/unix, to old computers and phones, to modding, to homebrew, to keyboards, to mice, to audio, to controllers, to system administration, to media codecs, to emulation, to vr/xr/mr, and probably more than im totally forgetting. im the kind of nerd that will host web services and gameservers for fun and not money. if you wanna know exactly what devices and software i use, check out the tech page (when its done)!</p>

<p><b>another long time interest of mine is games.</b> i grew up with a playstation 2, wii, and a ds, the latter 2 of which were able to run pirated games through a <a href="https://www.gamebrew.org/wiki/NeoGamma_Wii">homebrew backup loader</a> and an r4 card respectively. nowadays i do most of my gaming on pc, but i do have some consoles lying around like a switch, xbox 360, ps3, a wii u, a 3ds, and a ps vita. im mainly into shooters, platformers, rhythm games, and vr stuff but i do stray and play some action-adventure games sometimes. the mainstay games i regularly come back to are team fortress 2, vrchat, minecraft, overwatch 2, osu!, counter-strike, battlebit remastered, beat saber, and dancerail3. i dont play many of the newer multiplayer shooters because i use linux which isnt compatible with most of the anticheats in use nowadays (also most of them just kinda suck). i sometimes go back and replay some of my favourite singleplayer games, too, like arkham city, oneshot, undertale, celeste, doom eternal, mirrors edge catalyst, gta v, sonic mania, and quite a few more. i also have a ton of games queued up for me to play too. if you wanna know what im playing now or have some suggestions about something i should play, feel free to contact me! if ive recently played a game thats particularly good, i might also blog about it (when the blog is finished), so check that out too</p>

<p><b>ive always been really big into vr.</b> i had the chance to try out a rift dk1 during my time at the london gadget show in 2015 and was immediately sold on the immersion, despite the narrow fov and 480p resolution. i eventually got my first vr headset, the rift cv1, in early 2021 and was addicted to it for a good long while. i unfortunately had to put vr down for a little while after switching to linux, because oculus discontinued their linux software in 2016 after they were bought by meta. i kept my eyes on <a href="https://github.com/thaytan/OpenHMD/tree/rift-kalman-filter">a promising driver</a>, but it never got to the quality i wanted. instead, i switched to a quest 2, and currently have a quest 3s, and use it wirelessly, a technology i was originally very skeptical on but have since come to love. always keep an open mind :p! my favourite vr games are beat saber, vrchat, boneworks, bonelab, arkham shadow, and minecraft. i had played vrchat before, when i had a rift cv1, but i didnt truly get into it until january 2025, where i was able to use vr to break through a lot of my social anxieties and make some amazing friends. i have a super jank vr setup involving a quest 3s, linux, patched <a href="https://github.com/SlimeVR/SolarXR-Protocol">solarxr</a> versions of <a href="https://github.com/notpeelz/WiVRn/tree/solarxr-patches">wivrn</a> and <a href="https://github.com/RinLovesYou/xrizer/tree/experimental2">xrizer</a>, <a href="https://github.com/galister/wlx-overlay-s">wlx-overlay-s</a>, and 7 <a href="https://slimevr.dev">slimevr</a> trackers and 3 extensions, which, yeah, means i dont use steamvr... tragic</p>

<p><b>i also consider myself to be pretty into music.</b> maybe others would disagree, since im very picky so the music i like to listen to most is pretty limited. i collect cds of my favourite albums and have a pretty big library of flacs. generally my favourite genres are punk rock, breakcore, electronic, dubstep, vaporwave, and sometimes ambient. my favourite bands/art/ists are blink-182, the offspring, geoxor, femtanyl, windows 96, neck deep, home, and whitewoods. if you wanna see what im listening to, check out the last.fm widget on the right of this page (or the bottom if youre on a phone) or just go to <a href="https://www.last.fm/user/s16le">my last.fm profile</a> directly. i scrobble everything i listen to, regardless of device or format (even ipods!). also feel free to ask me for my spotify playlists :3</p>

<p><b>i love photography and video creation too!</b> im no good at it, but i try my best, and its lots of fun. i have a cheap mirrorless camera i got from a used electronics store a few years ago and some entry level lens and edit them on a pirated copy of photomator. ive been messing around with basic video creation since discovering windows movie maker on the family pc when i was a kid. since then ive moved through many video editors, eventually settling on final cut pro, and have made lots of different kinds of videos, memes, tutorials, showcases, compilations, home movies, and even edited together a video that was played at a family members funeral. i have a bit of a history with making youtube videos and streaming, but all thats long gone now unfortunately. maybe ill pick it up again one day?</p>

<p><b>some smaller stuff about me:</b> i have quite a wide selection of pride flags, im really picky about food but i really like eating garbage, im absolutely obsessed with drinking pepsi max specifically, i like watching tv shows and movies (specifically cartoons), i hyperfixate on stuff a lot and have a few special interests, im very sex/kink/body positive, im politically very left, and ive been through a lot of shit so im pretty sensitive and mentally ill lol</p>

<p>if theres anything else you wanna know about me, or just wanna chat, dont be afraid to come talk to me! i consider myself pretty friendly and chill, but i might be a bit shy if i dont know you well yet. dont take it personally, i wont be annoyed or bite you (unless you want that), im just nervous x3</p>
